# Learn SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

There are no shortage of places or people promising to teach you SEO. The challenge is finding the folks actually worth listening to and learning from.

While I have been doing SEO going back to before it was even "officially" called "SEO" -- back when I got started we just used to call it getting real life people visit
our websites without having to pay money in order to do so. That was a good thing -- because most of the paid traffic options of today weren't an option back then :-)

That said, I don't think you should try and learn Search Engine Optimization from me -- not me alone anyway. Instead, I'll use this space to showcase the people, posts, 
and resources that I think are worth your time to learn. That certainly doesn't mean I'll get it right 100% of the time. I bet I don't get close, but hopefully you'll find
value in the information shared here just the same.

## Let's group SEO into 3 major categories:

* On-page SEO
* <a href="technical-seo" title="Technical SEO">Technical SEO</a>
* Off-page SEO

Of course there's tons of overlap in the three categories and you may well find resources in one that could easily go in one of the other. This is by no means meant to
be an exhaustive resource for learning search engine optimization. Anyone promising that -- run! I do think it'll be worth checking out often and hopefully sharing with others.

One important point before I continue -- when I refer to the work I do in the area of SEO, I always make the point to say "SEO & organic traffic strategy." 
Why the end part? Because search engine optimization refers to what happens i "traditional search engines" -- while super important to focus on it's also incredibly 
important to learn all about the vast number of other organic sources of traffic (i.e. non-paid) which can include the likes of Reddit, The social media platforms, Google Discover, 
and many more that can lead to great visibility without having to pay, yet aren't search engines (at least not how one traditionally thinks of them).

## Ready to begin learning SEO? 
Choose one of the sub-categories below to learn all about it!
