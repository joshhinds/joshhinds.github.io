# Learn SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

There’s no shortage of places or people promising to teach you SEO. The challenge is finding the folks actually worth listening to and learning from.

I have been doing search engine optimization going back to before it was even called “SEO”. Back when I got started we used to call it getting people to visit our websites without having to pay money to do so. That was a good thing because most of the paid traffic options of today weren't even an option back then :-)

That said, I don’t think you should try and learn Search Engine Optimization from me – not me alone anyway. Instead, I’ll use this site to showcase the people, posts, and resources that are worth your time to learn from. 

That doesn’t mean I’ll get it right 100% of the time. I bet I don’t even get close to 100% right, but I'm certain you’ll find value in the information shared here.

## Let's group SEO into 3 major categories:

* <a href="on-page-seo">On-Page SEO</a>
* <a href="technical-seo" title="Technical SEO">Technical SEO</a>
* <a href="off-page-seo.html">Off-Page SEO</a>

There's a lot of of overlap in the three categories and you may well find resources in one that could go in one or the other. This is not meant to be an end all source for learning search engine optimization. Anyone promising that -- run! I do think it'll be worth checking out often and sharing with others.

When I refer to the work I do in the area of SEO, I always make the point to say "SEO & organic traffic strategy." Why the end part? Because search engine optimization (SEO) refers to what happens in traditional search engines. 

It is also important to learn about all the other organic sources of traffic (i.e. non-paid). Sources like Reddit, various social media platforms, Google Discover, and many more.
