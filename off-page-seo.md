# Guide to Learn Off-Page SEO

Off-Page SEO refers to the actions taken outside your own website to help it rank in the search engines. Either by yourself or others.

Understand that search engines want to deliver trust worthy results. They use a variety of trust signals to do this. They also use ranking factors. Most trust signals are also ranking factors.

The Search engines don't make a habit of sharing their ranking factors, but a lot has been written about them.

Some known off-page trust signals are external links, citations, and mentions. A lot of people think links alone are important. Instead, it's relevant links from other high quality trusted sites that matter. Without those qualifiers it would be easy to game links as many did in the past.
