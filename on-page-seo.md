# On-Page SEO Learning Resources

Think of On-Page as anything on a website, or webpage that can be optimized in order to help the particular page rank better (i.e. gain better visibility). The possibilities here are quite wide ranging. You can optimize meta data (i.e. title tags, meta descriptions, etc), images, the content itself, the URL structure of pages on your site, and much more. Even the content itself that you choose or build upon can, and should be optimized. 

As you move through the resources included here you will see just how broad the topic of On-Page SEO is. After you have completed this section you’ll be well ahead of the many folks out there who mistakenly think doing SEO is just adding keywords to a page. The content and messaging part is super important of course, but that’s just a piece of the puzzle needed to win.
